  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a second-year engineering student in the Department of Computer Science with a strong focus on improving my coding skills and pushing myself to reach my full potential. 
  I'm always eager to learn new things and get involved in different projects where I can contribute and grow. 
  I take pride in continuously working on myself, both personally and professionally, and 
  I'm committed to making a meaningful impact on any team I join.</p>

<p>I'm driven by the belief that there's always room for improvement, and 
  I actively seek out opportunities that challenge me. Whether it's in class or in hands-on projects, 
  I aim to become not just a better coder but also a valuable team player. 
  For me, it's all about growth, learning, and making a difference wherever I can.</p>
